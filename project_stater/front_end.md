box-sizing: border-box:

is a CSS property that changes the way the width and height of an element are calculated. By default, the width and height of an element are calculated based on the content width and height, plus any padding, borders, and margins that are applied. This can make it difficult to accurately size elements, especially when using percentages or em units.

The box-sizing property allows you to change the box model used for an element. When you set box-sizing: border-box;, the width and height of the element are calculated based on the content width and height, plus any padding and borders that are applied. The margin is then added outside of the element's specified width and height.

In other words, when you use box-sizing: border-box;, the total width of an element (including padding and border) is included in the width property that you set. This can make it easier to create layouts and size elements consistently across different browsers and devices.
